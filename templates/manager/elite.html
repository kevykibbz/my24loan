      <h4>Card Benefits</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-12 m-b-20 text-justify">
        <p>Once you enroll at {{obj.site_name}}, respective team will ask for your loan related document. We then make a file of all your documents and send them to multiple partnering NBFC Banks. NBFC banks check your profile, matches them to required profile and give approval of loan. If your profile matches in more than one NBFC Banks, {{obj.site_name}} will provide you list of approving NBFC Banks, saving you a great amount of time of going into multiple banks for loan.</p>
        <p>This is one of the most important benefit of our company's membership card, because getting a loan is time consuming process. In daily busy routine no one has time to visit multiple banks for loan process so here our company is providing this facility at one platform. Secondly every time you open your file at a bank for loan, your CIBIL score gets deducted, but with {{obj.site_name}} your file will only open in those banks where your profile matches, helping you in a better CIBIL score even if you don't take a loan.</p>
